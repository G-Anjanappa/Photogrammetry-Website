                The American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) defines it as as “the art, science,
                and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment, through

            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                The aerial photogrammetry is a branch which comprises the collection of aerial imagery with the
                objective of producing 2D and 3D topographic maps, orthophotos and digital terrain models by its

            <h4><strong>PHOTOGRAMMETRIC WORKFLOW</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                Photogrammetric workflow is the sequence of steps to be followed from the definition of the project
                demands and constraints, going through the acquisition of the images and its processing to the final
                product's obtainment.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4><strong>FLIGHT PLANNING</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                It is the stage of Photogrammetric workflow that defines the means and methods for the images' primary
                acquisition. It is chosen the equipment and method to obtain the accuracy of extracted geo-information
                and the spatial and spectral resolution of imagery according to the project's necessities and taken into
                account the possible flight restrictions and weather and environmental conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                For this purpose, it is decided what sensor, lens, flight height, and image overlap will be used, and
                also chosen the use of GNSS or IMU and the location of ground control points.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4><strong>GROUND CONTROL DETERMINATION</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                During this stage, the ground control points chosen in the previous step are materialized in the ground
                and have their coordinates registered for future image orientation.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY/IMAGE ACQUISITION</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                It is the phase where the proper flight for image acquisition is performed, following the planning
                premises.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>TRIANGULATION / ORIENTATION</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                The following processing step is to correlate the coordinates of points in the acquired image with the
                terrain's coordinates. The process starts with the External Orientation, where the terrain coordinates
                are converted into camera coordinates. After it, the coordinates are converted from 3D to 2D, have their
                possible less distortions corrected, and finally converted to the digital image coordinate system in the
                Internal Orientation. The processing then takes the digital image coordinates. During the Relative
                Orientation, the images are connected using the coincident points recorded in those images to create a
                stereo pair model or a block/bundle of images model. It is possible to extract height measurements on
                the features covered in at least two images. The Absolute Orientation places these models back in the
                world, and the triangulation places the whole image bundles. The digital image coordinates are then
                correlated to terrain coordinates, completing the full cycle. </p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>DATA COLLECTION</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-black text-justify">
                Data is extracted from the images, as Digital Surface Models, Digital Terrain Models, and Orthophotos,
                after all the preliminary procedures are finished.
